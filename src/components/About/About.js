          I am a passionate data scientist and software developer. My journey to
           software development started out of curiosity, wanting to know how websites were built. That curiosity soon turned into a hobby. From then on, I have upskilled myself gaining various skills ranging from web development to data science and machine learning:- to build viable and efficient websites and technologies.
           I believe in the use of technology to makework easier, faster and more efficient. I believe also that technology will have a big role in solving some of the challenges we are facingtoday like insecurity, and diseases without cures.<br />
